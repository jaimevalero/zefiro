# Initial case: **Personal Data:**  
**Example Case:** Ana Garcia  

Ana is a 42-year-old secondary school teacher living in Madrid with her husband Miguel, a 45-year-old engineer. Together, they have a mortgage of €180,000 at 25 years, with a monthly payment of €750 and a variable interest rate of Euribor +0.9%. They have 18 years left to pay off their home, which is currently valued at €320,000.  

Ana recently inherited €75,000 from her aunt and wants to start investing more seriously. She currently owns a modest portfolio of shares purchased three years ago:  
- 30 shares of Inditex (worth approximately €1,050)  
- 20 shares of Iberdrola (worth approximately €240)  
- 15 shares of Banco Santander (worth approximately €580)  

These shares were purchased based on advice from a family member without a clear strategy and represent a total investment of around €1,870. She has not conducted any transactions since the purchase.  

Ana works as a stable public sector teacher with an annual salary of €45,000, while her husband earns €52,000 per year. They have a 12-year-old son and are considering having a second child in the coming years. Their main financial goals are to create a solid investment plan for:  
- Complementing their retirement (25-year horizon)  
- Building a fund for their son's university education (6-year horizon)  
- Maintaining a secure financial safety net for emergencies  

Ana has basic financial knowledge, having read some blogs on investing, but she feels unsure about how to proceed with the significant amount of money from the inheritance. She prefers a conservative-to-moderate approach due to concerns about market volatility, especially given their substantial mortgage payments. She is particularly interested in sustainable (ESG) investments and wants to understand the tax implications of her decisions. Additionally, she is concerned about how to integrate her existing shares into her new investment strategy and whether she should keep or sell them to create a more coherent portfolio.  

Both Ana and Miguel have individual pension plans through their employers with modest monthly contributions, but they have never conducted a comprehensive analysis of their financial situation or developed a clear strategy for optimizing their investments considering their mortgage obligations.

# 0 Report: Detailed User Risk Profile Report  
**RISK PROFILE REPORT - ANA GARCIA**  
*Compliance with ESMA MiFID II parameters*  

---

## **1. Demographic and Financial Analysis**  
- **Age:** 42 years (long-term investment perspective)  
- **Dual Temporal Horizon:**  
  - Short-Medium Term (6 years): University education fund  
  - Long-Term (25+ years): Retirement supplement  
- **Economic Situation:**  
  - Stable family income: €97,000 per year (€45,000 + €52,000)  
  - Significant financial commitments: Variable mortgage of €180,000 (18 years remaining, Euribor+0.9%)  
  - Initial liquid assets: €1,870 in shares + €75,000 inheritance  
- **Estimated Net Worth:**  
  - Assets: €320,000 (home) + €75,000 (inheritance) + €1,870 (shares) = €396,870  
  - Liabilities: €180,000 (mortgage) → Net worth: €216,870  

---

## **2. Risk Tolerance Evaluation (ESMA Scale 1-7)**  
**Final Classification: Level 3 - Conservative with moderate elements**  

_Determining Factors:_  
- **Moderate Risk Capacity:**  
  - Significant financial commitments (variable mortgage + plans for family expansion)  
  - Debt/income ratio: 1.85 (€180,000 debt vs €97,000 income) → Exposure to Euribor increases  
- **Attitude Toward Risk:**  
  - Declared as conservative-moderate  
  - Investment history: Non-strategic equity portfolio (2.6% of the inheritance received), "buy and hold" behavior  
  - Estimated volatility threshold: Maximum acceptable short-term at -12%  
- **Data Consistency:**  
  - Contradiction detected between current portfolio (100% variable income) and declared profile → Requires rebalancing  

---

## **3. Investment Priorities (Order of Importance)**  
1. **Emergency Fund:**  
   - Identified need: 6 months of expenses (estimated €22,500 considering €3,750/month)  
   - Proposed vehicle: High-yield accounts/Short-term deposits (100% capital guarantee)  
2. **Education Fund (6 years):**  
   - Accumulation objective: €35,000-€45,000  
   - Strategy: Moderate profile (40% variable income/60% fixed income)  
   - Suggested products: Indexed ESG funds with 2029 horizon + investment-grade corporate bonds  
3. **Retirement Supplement (25+ years):**  
   - Objective: Take advantage of compound interest with ESG exposure  
   - Proposed allocation: 60% variable income (Global ESG ETF) + 30% green fixed income + 10% alternatives (sustainable infrastructure funds)  

---

## **4. Analysis of Current Portfolio and Recommendations**  
- **Current Positions:**  
  - 100% single-stock Spain exposure (Inditex 56%, Iberdrola 13%, Santander 31%)  
  - Historical volatility: +35% vs Ibex-35 over the last 3 years  
- **Recommendations:**  
  - Sell progressively (take advantage of tax exemption for transmissions <€6,000/year)  
  - Reinvest in an ESG European ETF (e.g., MSCI Europe ESG Screened) to maintain sectoral exposure with diversification  
  - Consider donating up to €2,000 in shares for tax benefits (Law 49/2002)  

---

## **5. Special Considerations**  
- **Impact of Variable Mortgage:**  
  - Stress test scenario (Euribor at 4%): Monthly payment would increase to €1,130 (+50%) → Limits savings capacity  
- **Fiscal Strategy:**  
  - Prioritize products with efficient taxation (pension plans up to €1,500/year per holder)  
  - Use a savings life insurance for the education fund (tax exemption after 5 years)  
- **ESG Factors:**  
  - Suggested substitution ratio: Minimum 40% in Article 8/9 SFDR funds  
  - Exclude sectors: Thermal coal (>1% revenue), controversial arms  

---

## **6. Regulatory Validation**  
- **MiFID II Suitability Test Passed**  
- **Non-Recommended Products:**  
  - Leveraged derivatives (CFDs, futures)  
  - Risk capital/private equity  
  - Unregulated crypto assets  
- **Required Documentation:**  
  - KID/KIID for all proposed funds  
  - Periodic report on consolidated costs  

---

## **Final Conclusion:**  
Ana Garcia requires a strategy centered on preserving capital while taking advantage of long-term ESG opportunities. The combination of an emergency fund, moderate educational investment, and gradual market exposure within her retirement horizon, along with tax optimization, creates a profile consistent with her risk level 3. Annual review is recommended with a focus on interest rate evolution and family circumstances.

# Report 4: Detailed Tax Guide with Practical Scenarios

**Detailed Tax Guide for Ana Garcia - Case Study**

---

### **1. Dividend Withholding Tax (19%)**  
**Calculation Mechanism:**  
- All dividends received (individual stocks + ETFs/distributing funds) are taxed at 19% upon payment  
- Practical example for current portfolio:  
  - Iberdrola (DY 4.1%): 20 shares x EUR12 = EUR240 capital -> EUR9.84 annual dividends  
  - Withholding: EUR9.84 x 19% = **EUR1.87** annually  
  - Banco Santander (DY 5% capital -> EUR29 dividends -> Withholding **EUR5.51**

**Optimization Strategy:**  
- Prioritize cumulative ETFs for deferred tax until sale (e.g., Vanguard ESG Global All Cap)  
- Offset withholdings with capital gains in annual declaration  

---

### **2. Capital Gains Simulation by Time Horizons**  
**Scenarios for Inheritance EUR75k:**

| Horizon | Product                        | Projected Gain  | Effective Taxation* |
|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 6 years | Lyxor Green Bond ETF           | EUR4,200 (2.8% annually) | 19% (EUR798)            |
| 12 years| Xtrackers Infrastructure       | EUR18,000 (6% annually)  | 19% (EUR3,420)          |
| 25 years| iShares MSCI ESG Enhanced      | EUR67,500 (7% annually)  | 23% (EUR15,525)         |

*Assuming IRPF brackets for 2024:  
- First EUR6,000 -> 19%  
- EUR6,001-EUR50,000 -> 21%  
- >EUR50,000 -> 23%

**Progressive Sale Strategy:**  
- Liquidate EUR4,800 annually from inherited portfolio (limiting to lower 21% bracket)  
- Example for 2024: Sell 30% Enel Green Power -> Gain EUR1,440 -> Taxation at 19% (EUR273.60)

---

### **3. Tax Benefits of Pension Plans**  
**Joint Optimization (Ana + Miguel):**  
- Maximum deductible contribution: EUR1,500/year each -> Base reduction of **EUR3,000** annually  
- Example BBVA Futuro Sostenible:  
  - Contribution EUR125/month -> Annual deduction EUR1,500  
  - Immediate tax saving: EUR1,500 x 30% marginal rate = **EUR450**/year

**Golden Rule:**  
M + contributions to pension plans should not exceed 15% of annual income.

---

### **4. Specific Exemptions and Deductions Applicable**  
- **Article 33 Tax Law:** Reinvestment exemption for primary residence (not applicable as apartment is already paid off)  
- **Law 49/2002:** 35% deduction for donations of ESG stocks to environmental NGOs  
- **Madrid Incentive:** 15% reduction on municipal capital gains tax when selling ESG assets
